  Functions of the program:
  When you click on the grid, depending on the player, the grid will be blue or red
  if the player gets 4 in a row, then the player wins
  each slot on the grid has a numerical value from 0 - 41
  message displayed when someone wins
  game stops functioning if someone win
  Can only choose a spot on the grid if the space below it has been used, and the current space hasnt been used

  Global Variables: 
  let player = 1
  playing = true

  Winner function
  Need to loop through all arrays
  for (let y = 0: i < length winning arrays; y++){
    square1 = square[winningarray[y][0]]
    square2 = square[winningarray[y][1]]
    square3 = square[winningarray[y][2]]
    square4 = square[winningarray[y][3]]
  }
  if square1.classlist.contains('player-one'), repeat this
  if all 4 squares contain player one
  result.textContent = 'player 1 wins'

  Click function

  for (i < winningarrays.length){
    
    squares[i].onclick = () => {
if space below isnt taken and current space isnt taken

    }

  }
